/*
we will make a simple dart project that will be like a metro application
it will ask user for start station and end station
and then it will show the shortest path between them depending on number of stations

first we will declare the 3 lines of metro
second we will ask the user for start and end stations
then we will find the shortest path between them
we will use BFS algorithm to find the shortest path
we will use a map to represent the metro lines and stations
